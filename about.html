  <p>I am a UX designer with a background Digital Marketing, Tech Sales and Interpreting. After graduating from college I was always working in Digital and Tech field where I always kept up with the new trends. Working with the developers sharpened my analytical way of thinking. I’m deeply curious and obsessed with how things could work better, that’s why I have always loved the research process. I accustomed to work with the team and at the same time can work on my own; in a fast-paced startup and in an organized company environments. Now, I’m looking forward to applying this skills to UX Design process to make a positive impact on people’s experience with the products.</p>
